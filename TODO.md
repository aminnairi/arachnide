- Find a solution to prevent event listeners rebind on each render (useCallback?, `actions` property)
- Add a solution to create a state that does not involve visual re-render (react ref like?)
- Find a way to type the parameters in the pages in TypeScript
- Use curly braces instead of double-dots for defining a route parameter
- Documentation for @arachnide/css
- Documentation for @arachnide/html
- Documentation for @arachnide/event
- More events for @arachnide/event
- External library for easing the use of SVG elements (@arachnide/svg)
- Add ESLint for TypeScript & good practice linting as well as code formatting (no prettier) and run the linter in a GitHub Action
- Documentation for the whole API
- Publish the NPM package
- Add badges (NPM, License, bundle size, ...)
- Create a cool logo
- Add a solution to be able to key elements for optimization purpose and figure out what we need to do with keyed elements
- Add a package for mathml components (`@arachnide/mathml`)
- Allow the state to either be a state or a state constructor function in the `createApplication` function only
- Put the example in the `packages/example` folder
- Create a `@arachnide/create` package in order to use the command `npm create @arachnide` and scafold a new project
- Figure out how to create batch updates (might not be necessary and can be userland thanks to the `update` handler)
- Figure out lazy loading of elements and if this is a good idea to implement in the framework or not (React suspense-like)
- Add support for the View Transition Web API (provide more options for the `pages` props in this case)
- Add a section about the security, especially when using the attributes `textContent` and `innerHTML` with untrusted sources
- Try to find vulnerabilities, resolve them & document them if they are part of the standard HTML spec
- Lazy load the CSS stylesheet and use a preload link
- Rename DOMReference to simply Reference as it could be used for non-rendereable state updates as well
- Create a `@arachnide/accessibility` package that enforces best practice for accessibility in the Web
- Create a `isVirtualHTMLElement` helper function and use it wherever possible
- Rename `element` to `createElement`
- Create a `VirtualSVGElement` class
- Create a `VirtualMathMLElement` class
- Create a `createMathMLElement` function
- Create a `createSVGElement` function
- Create a `isVirtualSVGElement` helper
- Create a `isVirtualMathMLElement` helper
- Rename `VirtualHTMLElement` to `VirtualNamedElement` instead since it serves the `html`, `svg` & `mathml` libraries
- Add a third generic type for the `startApplication` to allow typing the routes and unlock features like type checked route in the `changePage` function 
- Add a `isVirtualElementAttributeRemoved` helper function to ease out the reading of the source-code in the `@arachnide/core` package
- Find a better solution that throwing in the source-code of `@arachnide/core` for errors (warnings? log adapter? error return?)
- Slice through the attributes that needs to be added in order to prevent looping over attributes again
- Add comments where missing in the source-code of all of the packages
- Make the changePage handle better when feeded with dynamic parameters
- Handle an error where the user cannot go back to the previous page without error if the current page was an unknown page
